# Deeplearning_Handwritten_Digitrecognition

Created a baseline neural network model implemented on german digits(hand written digits) dataset, for the baseline model - hyperparameter best model accuracy on the validation data is 86%. 
further, implemented tensorflow and keras model, tuning hyperparameter yield best model. Validation accuracy reported on the best model is 90% and plotted few missclassified images and its probability class predicted by the best model.
